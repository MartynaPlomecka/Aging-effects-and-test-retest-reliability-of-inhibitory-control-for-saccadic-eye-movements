## Aging effects and test-retest reliability of inhibitory control for saccadic eye movements
 The antisaccade task, widely used in the study of inhibitory control, offers a window onto the
operation of executive functioning. This study established that the measures proposed by the
internationally standardized antisaccades protocol are reliable over time and therefore
constitute meaningful and suitable estimates for future longitudinal studies and identifying
promising biomarkers for cognitive decline. Furthermore, older subjects exhibited longer
saccadic reaction times and significantly higher average error rates. We further decomposed
the task with computational models. We expanded previous findings by showing that aging
differences in reaction time and error rate can be explained by fast or slow inhibition and the
probability of generating late voluntary prosaccades.

### Study Description

Neuropsychological studies indicate that healthy aging is associated with a decline of
inhibitory control of attentional and behavioral systems. A widely accepted measure of
inhibitory control is the antisaccade task that requires both the inhibition of a reflexive
saccadic response towards a visual target and the initiation of a voluntary eye movement in
the opposite direction. To better understand the nature of age-related differences in inhibitory
control, we evaluated antisaccade task performance in 78 younger (20-35 years) and 78 older
(60-80 years) participants. In order to provide reliable estimates of inhibitory control for
individual subjects, we investigated test-retest reliability of the reaction time, error rate,
saccadic gain and peak saccadic velocity and further estimated latent, not directly observable
processed contributing to changes in the antisaccade task execution. The Intraclass
Correlation Coefficients for an older group of participants emerged as good to excellent for
most of our antisaccade task measures. Furthermore, using Bayesian multivariate models, we
inspected age-related differences in the performances of healthy younger and older
participants. The older group demonstrated higher error rates, longer reaction times,
significantly more inhibition failures, and late prosaccades as compared to young adults. The
consequently lower ability of older adults to voluntarily inhibit saccadic responses has been
interpreted as an indicator of age-related inhibitory control decline. Additionally, we
performed a Bayesian model comparison of used computational models and concluded that
the SERIA model explains our data better than PROSA that does not incorporate a late
decision process.
