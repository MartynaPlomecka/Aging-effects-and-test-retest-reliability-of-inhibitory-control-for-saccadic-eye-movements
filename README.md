## Aging effects and test-retest reliability of inhibitory control for saccadic eye movements
 The antisaccade task, widely used in the study of inhibitory control, offers a window onto the
operation of executive functioning. This study established that the measures proposed by the
internationally standardized antisaccades protocol are reliable over time and therefore
constitute meaningful and suitable estimates for future longitudinal studies and identifying
promising biomarkers for cognitive decline. Furthermore, older subjects exhibited longer
saccadic reaction times and significantly higher average error rates. We further decomposed
the task with computational models. We expanded previous findings by showing that aging
differences in reaction time and error rate can be explained by fast or slow inhibition and the
probability of generating late voluntary prosaccades.

###### Figure: (A) the experimental procedure of a single run, consisting of prosaccade task (PRO) and antisaccade task (ANTI) blocks, which each consisted of either 40 or 60 trials per block. There was a 1-min between each block. 
###### (B) Schematic top view of the experimental setup and gaze behavior during a prosaccade and antisaccade condition trial. The black square represents the target fixation, and the black dot represents the peripheral stimulus. The peripheral stimulus is presented 1000 ms on the screen and starts after a duration of the target fixation of 800-1200 ms.
######  (C) The sequence of latent events assumed by the Stochastic Early Reaction, Inhibition and Late Action (SERIA) Model, generating as output either early prosaccades (EARLY PRO), late prosaccades (LATE PRO), or antisaccade events (LATE ANTI).
