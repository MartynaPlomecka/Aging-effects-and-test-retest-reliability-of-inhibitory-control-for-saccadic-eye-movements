The antisaccade task, widely used in the study of inhibitory control, offers a window onto the operation of executive functioning. This study established that the measures proposed by the internationally standardized antisaccades protocol are reliable over time and therefore constitute meaningful and suitable estimates for future longitudinal studies and identifying promising biomarkers for cognitive decline. Furthermore, older subjects exhibited longer saccadic reaction times and significantly higher average error rates. We further decomposed the task with computational models. We expanded previous findings by showing that aging differences in reaction time and error rate can be explained by fast or slow inhibition and the probability of generating late voluntary prosaccades.
